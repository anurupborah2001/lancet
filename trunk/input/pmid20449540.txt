Aspirin at a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight was found to decrease the
      activity of the rat intestinal brush border membrane (BBM) - associated
      enzymes such as the sucrase, lactase, maltase and alkaline phosphatase.
      Aspirin treatment also led to a decrease in the microviscosity in the
      native as well as the benzyl alcohol treated membrane which might be due
      to the lipid peroxidative damage in the membrane. Physical correlation of
      the membrane oxidative damage was evident as the Fourier Transformation
      Infra Red (FTIR) study of the Aspirin treated membrane, which include an
      increased proportion of gauche to trans conformer, shift in the methylene
      C-H asymmetric and symmetric stretching frequencies, C = O double bond
      stretching, NH bending, antisymmetric (N)-CH3 bending, C-N stretching and
      antisymmetric CNC stretching while there was no change in the CH2 wagging
      and twisting as well as in NH-bending amide bond I and II. Aspirin
      treatment also caused an alteration in the glucose and histidine
      transport, as evident by a decreased Vmax value while the apparent Km
      remaining unchanged in the control and Aspirin-treated animals confirming
      that there was no change in the substrate affinity constant of the
      membrane transport proteins for the glucose and the basic amino acid,
      although the rate of transport decreased considerably. There was a
      decrease noted in the energy of activation of glucose and histidine
      transport when studied at different temperature but no change in the
      temperature of phase transition in the BBM with Aspirin treatment, thus
      implying that perhaps the thermotropic phase transition in the membrane
      may have relatively little effect on the transport processes. The result
      suggests an underlying molecular mechanism indicating the implied membrane
      damage by Aspirin, an important member of the non-steroidal
      antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) family which could possibly through an
      oxidative damage may lead to an altered molecular structure, physical
      state and biological functions of the intestinal membrane.
